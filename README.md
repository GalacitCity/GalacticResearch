# GalacticResearch

Minecraft Mod, addon for Galacticraft, which brings planet research functionality.
In order to travel in space you need to research planets.

The flow:
1. Find and collect initial planet data in telescope.
2. Send satellite in space with collected data in #1
3. Collect and process new data from satellites
4. ???
5. You can fly to the opened planet

1. Observe asteroids in telescope
2. Send mining rocket to mine them

Automate all the flow with OpenComputers or ComputerCraft

And very important note. All flow can be automated with OpenComputers.
But if you're not familiar with computers, you'll have to waste some time during manual research.
